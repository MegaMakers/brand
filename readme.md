## The MegaMaker brand

The community we've built inside of MegaMaker is amazing. We're geeks who like to make things!

Many of our members want to wear a MegaMaker t-shirt at a conference, or put a sticker on their laptop.

While members [can purchase](https://store.megamaker) t-shirts, hats, and stickers, sometimes it's cost prohibitive to do that.

While I technically own the trademark for MegaMaker, I want to enable members to print their own apparel + stickers if it's cheaper for them to do so.
