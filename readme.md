## The MegaMaker brand

The community we've built inside of MegaMaker is amazing. We're geeks who like to make things!

Many of our members want to wear a MegaMaker t-shirt at a conference, or put a sticker on their laptop.

While members [can purchase](https://store.megamaker) t-shirts, hats, and stickers, sometimes it's cost prohibitive to do that (especially for folks outside of North America - shipping is expensive!).

While I technically own the trademark for MegaMaker, I want to enable members to print their own apparel + stickers if it's cheaper for them to do so.

### Legal wording

> You may make t-shirts, desktop wallpaper, or other merchandise with MegaMaker Marks on them, though only for yourself and your friends (meaning people from whom you don’t receive anything of value in return). You can’t put the trademarks on anything that you produce commercially (whether or not you make a profit) — at least not without receiving written permission.
